# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This project is part of a Triple Ten curriculum designed to teach students advanced HTML, CSS, and adaptive web design. It also introduces the implementation of the BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) methodology. The page is structured using semantic elements, with components named according to the BEM convention. Styles are organized within a dedicated blocks folder, and all stylesheets are imported into the index.css file, which is linked in the <head> section of the HTML document.
## Project features
